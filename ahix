Health insurance is more than just a safety net; it's a vital part of protecting your health and financial well-being. Here’s why having health insurance is crucial:


1. Financial Protection: 
Health insurance helps cover medical expenses, which can be overwhelming without coverage. It ensures you’re not faced with high medical bills that could strain your finances.
2. Access to Quality Care: 
With insurance, you can access a network of doctors, hospitals, and specialists. This means timely treatment and the best care available.
3. Preventive Services: 
Many health plans cover preventive services like vaccinations and screenings at no extra cost, helping you stay healthy and catch potential issues early.
4. Peace of Mind: 
Knowing you have coverage means you can focus on your health without worrying about unexpected medical costs.
